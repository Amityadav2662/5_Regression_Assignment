    "# Q1. What is Elastic Net Regression and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "Elastic Net Regression is a powerful technique that combines the strengths of both Lasso and Ridge Regression,\n",
    "offering a more flexible and robust approach for linear regression. It uses a combination of L1 (Lasso-like) and\n",
    "L2 (Ridge-like) penalties on coefficients, achieving both feature selection and coefficient shrinkage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to other techniques:\n",
    "More flexible than Lasso: Offers finer control over feature selection and sparsity.\n",
    "Less prone to overfitting than Ridge: Due to its ability to eliminate features.\n",
    "Good interpretability: Similar to Lasso, allows you to identify important features."

    "# Q2. How do you choose the optimal values of the regularization parameters for Elastic Net Regression?\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "Elastic Net throws in two tuning parameters: alpha (controls L1 penalty) and lambda (combined penalty strength).\n",
    "Finding the optimal combo can be tricky, but here are some key approaches:\n",
    "1. Grid Search: While computationally expensive, it systematically tests various alpha and lambda combinations, \n",
    "evaluating each on your data and choosing the best performing pair.\n",
    "2. Random Search: More efficient than grid search for large datasets, it randomly samples different parameter \n",
    "combinations and picks the one with the best performance.\n",
    "3. Cross-validation: Divide your data into folds, train models with different alpha and lambda combinations on \n",
    "each fold, and choose the pair with the best average performance on unseen data."

    "Ans.\n",
    "Elastic Net Regression offers several advantages over other regression techniques:\n",

    "Advantages:\n",
    "1. Combines strengths of Lasso and Ridge: Provides both feature selection like Lasso and robustness to \n",
    "multicollinearity like Ridge.\n",
    "2. Improves generalization: Often leads to better performance on unseen data compared to individual techniques.\n",
    "3. Balances bias and variance: Offers more flexibility than Lasso in controlling sparsity, potentially reducing \n",
    "overfitting risks.\n",
    "4. Good interpretability: Like Lasso, it identifies important features by setting some coefficients to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "1. More complex than Lasso or Ridge: Introduces two tuning parameters (alpha and lambda), requiring more careful\n",
    "calibration.\n",
    "2. Computationally expensive: Finding optimal parameters can be computationally demanding, especially with large \n",
    "datasets.\n",
    "3. Interpretability trade-off: While offering feature selection, the exact impact of each feature might be less \n",
    "clear due to combined L1 and L2 penalties."
